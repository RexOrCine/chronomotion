chronomotion
============

Chronomotion is a software to control the Merlin/Orion/Skywatcher remote head for shooting motion controlled time lapse. The software should allow custom bezier shaped movement curves with ramping and complex motion sequences. Please note that you require a special (TTL converter) cable to connect the head to a computers serial port.
